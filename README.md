- **Node.js** with Express
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose ODM (supports MongoDB Atlas)
- **Socket.IO** for real-time events
- **JWT** for authentication
- **Speakeasy** for TOTP-based 2FA
- **QRCode** for 2FA QR code generation
- **Redis** for caching (optional with fallback)
- **Bcrypt** for password hashing
- **dotenv** for environment configuration

## 📋 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ (or compatible LTS)
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB instance)
- Redis (optional, for caching - falls back to in-memory cache)
- Google Authenticator app (optional, for 2FA testing)

### Environment Setup

**Important environment variables (backend)**

Create a `.env` file in `gameverse/backend`:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database (MongoDB Atlas or local)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/gameverse
# Or for local: mongodb://localhost:27017/gameverse

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_here_change_in_production
JWT_EXPIRE=7d

# Frontend URL (for CORS and Socket.IO)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Optional: Redis (for caching - will use in-memory fallback if not set)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Optional: Email Configuration (for notification emails)
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

**Frontend environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in `gameverse/frontend`:

```env
# API Base URL
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

For Netlify Dev locally, set `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/api` to match the proxy.

**Production (Netlify + Render) templates**

- Backend: copy [gameverse/backend/.env.example](gameverse/backend/.env.example) into `gameverse/backend/.env` and set `FRONTEND_URL` to your Netlify domain
- Frontend: copy [gameverse/frontend/.env.example](gameverse/frontend/.env.example) into `gameverse/frontend/.env` and set `VITE_API_URL`/`VITE_SOCKET_URL` to your Render backend

### Installation & Running

**1. Start the backend API**

```powershell
cd "H:\My Website\GameHUB\gameverse\backend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000` (or the PORT you specified).

**2. Database is pre-populated with 49 games**

The game database is already populated with a curated collection of 49 games. You can verify this by checking MongoDB Atlas or by accessing `/api/games` in the browser once the backend is running.

To add more games (optional):

```powershell
cd "H:\My Website\GameHUB\gameverse\backend"
node scripts/populatePopularGames.js
```

**3. Start the frontend (Vite)**

```powershell
cd "H:\My Website\GameHUB\gameverse\frontend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173` or another available port shown by Vite.

**4. Full-stack via Netlify Dev (optional)**

```powershell
cd "H:\My Website\GameHUB"
npm install -g netlify-cli
npm run dev:netlify
```

Netlify Dev serves the Vite build and proxies API calls to `/.netlify/functions/api` on `http://localhost:8888`.

**4. Create an admin user (optional)**

Use the convenience script to create or promote an admin user:

```powershell
cd "H:\My Website\GameHUB\gameverse\backend"
node .\scripts\createAdmin.js admin@example.com securePassword123 adminuser
```

The script will promote an existing user with that email to `admin` or create a new admin user if none exists.

### Development Tips

- **Both servers together**: Use Windows Terminal with split panes or a process manager like `concurrently`
- **TypeScript checks**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` in the frontend directory
- **Hot reloading**: Both frontend (Vite) and backend (nodemon) support hot reloading
- **Port conflicts**: If port 5000 or 5173 is in use, either free it or set a different `PORT` in the backend `.env`
- **Single command (Netlify Dev)**: `npm run dev:netlify` proxies API to `/.netlify/functions/api` on port 8888

### Codebase Cleanup & Refactoring

This project was recently refactored to remove legacy code and external API dependencies:

- **Removed 27 files**: Old controllers, seed scripts, deployment documentation, and test utilities
- **Simplified feedController**: Removed RapidAPI/RAWG/FreeToGame external API calls (~50 lines of code)
- **Database-first architecture**: All data now sourced from MongoDB Atlas, no external API dependencies
- **Clean package.json**: Removed unused npm scripts and simplified dependencies
- **See [REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md](./REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md) for complete details of all changes**

```

This simulates two clients connecting and exchanging messages.

### TypeScript Type Checking

Verify TypeScript types without emitting files:

```powershell
cd "H:\My Website\GameHUB\gameverse\frontend"
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend won't start**
- Check if MongoDB is running: `mongod --version`
- Verify `.env` file exists in `gameverse/backend`
- Ensure `MONGODB_URI` is correct
- Check if port 5000 is already in use

**Frontend can't connect to backend**
- Verify backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`
- Check `VITE_API_URL` in `gameverse/frontend/.env`
- Look for CORS errors in browser console
- Ensure JWT token is saved in localStorage

**Socket.IO not connecting**
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Verify `FRONTEND_URL` in backend `.env`
- Ensure Socket.IO port matches backend port
- Check firewall settings

**Database connection errors**
- Ensure MongoDB service is running (or MongoDB Atlas is accessible)
- Verify connection string format
- For local: `mongodb://localhost:27017/gameverse`
- For Atlas: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/gameverse`
- Check network connectivity for cloud databases

**2FA issues**
- Ensure `speakeasy` and `qrcode` packages are installed
- Verify time sync between server and authenticator app
- Check that 2FA secret is properly stored in database
- For testing, use a TOTP generator or Google Authenticator app

**Game library empty**
- Run the population script: `node scripts/populatePopularGames.js`
- Check MongoDB connection is working
- Verify 50 games were inserted successfully
- Review backend logs for database errors

## 🔐 Two-Factor Authentication Setup

GameVerse supports TOTP-based 2FA for enhanced account security.

### Enabling 2FA

1. **Login to your account**
2. **Navigate to Profile page**
3. **Find "Security Settings" section**
4. **Click "Enable 2FA" button**
5. **Scan QR code** with Google Authenticator, Authy, or compatible app
6. **Enter 6-digit code** from authenticator app
7. **Click "Verify & Activate"**

### Using 2FA for Login

Once enabled, the login flow changes:

1. **Enter email and password** as normal
2. **2FA prompt appears** after password validation
3. **Enter current 6-digit code** from authenticator app
4. **Login completes** upon successful verification

### 2FA Architecture

- **TOTP Standard**: RFC 6238 Time-based One-Time Password
- **Secret Storage**: Encrypted in MongoDB with `select: false`
- **QR Generation**: Automatic via `qrcode` library
- **Validation**: 30-second time window with clock drift tolerance
- **Progressive**: Non-breaking change for existing users

### Supported Authenticator Apps

- Google Authenticator (iOS, Android)
- Microsoft Authenticator (iOS, Android)
- Authy (iOS, Android, Desktop)
- 1Password (with TOTP support)
- Any RFC 6238 compliant TOTP app

## ☁️ Deployment on Netlify + Render

Recommended production path: Netlify hosts the Vite frontend; Render runs the full Express + Socket.io backend.

**Quick Path (10–15 minutes)**
1. Deploy backend to Render: follow [RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) or use [render.yaml](render.yaml) (`rootDir: gameverse/backend`, health check `/api/health`).
2. Set Render env vars: `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRE`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `PORT=10000`.
3. Update Netlify env vars: `VITE_API_URL=https://<your-render>.onrender.com/api`, `VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://<your-render>.onrender.com`.
4. Deploy frontend to Netlify (auto-picks [netlify.toml](netlify.toml); publish `gameverse/frontend/dist`).
5. Verify `/api/health` and UI calls from `https://<your-site>.netlify.app` hit the Render backend.
